Welcome to Subtitle Sorcery, the magical realm where your subtitles transcend the barriers of language with just a flick of a command-line wand!

## What Is Subtitle Sorcery?

Subtitle Sorcery is a spellbinding Python script that uses the mystical powers of OpenAI to translate your mundane subtitle files into enchanting scripts of your desired language.

## How Does It Work?

Our wizardly script reads through your `.ass` subtitle files, carefully parsing the dialogue lines. It then consults the all-knowing OpenAI oracle to transmute those lines into the language of your choice.

*Behold as the wizard consults the oracle!*

## Features

- **Concurrent Translations**: Our potent spells allow for multiple subtitle files to be translated in parallel, saving precious time.
- **Command-Line Alchemy**: With a simple command, turn your subtitles from lead to gold (figuratively speaking, of course).
- **Extensible Enchantments**: Easy to extend with more complex incantations and plugins.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin your magical quest, you'll need:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- An OpenAI API key
- The `openai` Python package
- A heart brave enough to wield command-line incantations

## Installation

Clone this repository using your preferred method of Git sorcery:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/subtitle-sorcery.git
cd subtitle-sorcery
```

Create your virtual env:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Install the required Python packages via pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To start the translation spell, simply wave your command-line wand as follows:

```bash
python sorcery.py --target-lang es little1.ass little2.ass
```

Replace `es` with your target language code and `little1.ass little2.ass` with the list of subtitle files you wish to transmute.
